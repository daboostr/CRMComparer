# CRMComparer

Compare Dynamics CRM solution XML

# Features:

  -Graphical UI 

  -Compare Solutions Offline 

  -Supports Dynamics CRM 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2016 

  -Export results to Excel 

  -Supports reading solution.zip files (It will automatically unpack the customizations.xml)

# Known Issues: 

  -Object Type Code mismatches appear as changes.  (I'm working on implementing an option to exclude this difference). 

  -Error message if you click 'Ok' without selecting any files for comparison. 

  -Some elements show up as changed when </Format> tag appears on one side of the comparison.  (I believe this happens when comparing a 2011 solution with a 2013 solution.)
